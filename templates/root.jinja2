  "query": "Talk me about ...",  // Place user_query here
  "agents_run": [  
    {  
      "agent_name": "googleSearch_agent",  
      "response_data": null  
    },

  ],  
  "is_final": false,

    {  
      "agent_name": "googleSearch_agent",

} 

# Your final response 

{  
  "query": "Talk me about Espérance AYIWAHOUN",  
  "agents_run": [],  
  "next_steps": [],  
  "is_final": true,  
  "final_result": """   """  # Put the final answer here
} 

<END OF EXAMPLE>
```  


### Ongoing communication protocol:  
<START>
{{ user_query }} 
<END>

### Final steps:  
- When the maximum number of requests is reached, or enough information is available, **set `is_final` to true** and fill **`final_result`** with one or more explicit and well-structured paragraphs.  
- In case of a basic or out-of-context question, respond directly by setting `is_final` to 'true' and putting the answer in `final_result`.
- Formulate a few paragraphs with the information you have at hand.
