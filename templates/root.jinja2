### Ongoing communication protocol:  
<START>
{{ user_query }}

### Final steps:  
- When the maximum number of requests is reached, or enough information is available, **set `is_final` to true** and fill **`final_result`** with one or more explicit and well-structured paragraphs.  
- In case of a basic or out-of-context question, respond directly by setting `is_final` to 'true' and putting the answer in `final_result`.
- Formulate a few paragraphs with the information you have at hand.
